    "Here at Silicon Valley Data Science (SVDS), we have a slight obsession with the Caltrain. Our interest stems from the fact that half of our employees rely on the Caltrain to get to work each day. We also want to give back to the community, and we love when we can do that with data. When we have some breathing room between helping clients [build robust data systems](http://www.svds.com/building-data-systems-what-do-you-need/) or [use data to solve business challenges](http://www.svds.com/five-business-challenges-data-can-solve/), we like to work on R&D projects to explore technologies and experiment with new algorithms, hypotheses, and ideas. We previously [analyzed delays](http://www.svds.com/the-trains-project-analyzing-caltrain-delays/) using Caltrain's real-time API to improve arrival predictions, and we have [modeled the sounds](http://www.svds.com/listening-caltrain/) of passing trains to tell them apart. We're thrilled to share our latest R&D project, _Trainspotting_."

    "If you have ever ridden the train, you know that the delay estimates Caltrain provides can be a bit...off. Sometimes a train will remain \"two minutes delayed\" for ten minutes after the train was _already_ supposed to have departed, or delays will be reported when the train is on time. The idea for Trainspotting came from our desire to integrate new data sources for delay prediction beyond scraping [Caltrain's API](http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/realtime.html) . Since we had previously set up a Raspberry Pi to [analyze train whistles,](http://www.svds.com/listening-caltrain/) we thought it would be fun to validate the data coming from the Caltrain API by capturing  real-time video and audio of trains passing by our office near the Mountain View station."

    "After we were able to detect trains, their speed and their direction, we ran into a new problem. Our Pi was not only detecting Caltrains (true positive), but also detecting Union Pacific freight trains and the VTA light rail (false positive). In order to boost our detector's false positive rate, Matt used convolutional neural networks implemented in [Google's machine learning TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/image_recognition/index.html) library. We implemented a [custom Inception-V3 model](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/how_tos/image_retraining/index.html) trained on thousands of images of vehicles to identify different types of trains with >95% accuracy.

    "Before we even finished the development on our first device, we wanted to set up more of these devices to get ground truth at other points along the track. With this in mind, we realized that we couldn't always guarantee that we'd have a speedy internet connection, and we wanted to keep the devices themselves affordable. The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) is a great choice on both counts. The [Pi3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) has enough horsepower to do on-device stream processing so that we could send smaller, processed data streams over internet connections, and the parts are cheap. The total cost of our hardware for this sensor is $130, and the code relies only on open source libraries. In How-To Build a Deployable IoT Device using a Raspberry Pi, we'll walk through the device hardware and setup in detail and show you where you can get the code so you can start Trainspotting for yourself."
